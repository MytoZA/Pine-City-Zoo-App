                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals known for their distinctive black and white coloring. The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.</p>
                    <p>In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted dàmāoxióng (大貓熊; lit. 'giant cat bear'), though many encyclopedias and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making the name more grammatically and logically correct, which have led to the popular choice despite official writings.[9] This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.</p>
                    <p>They have a unique adaptation in their wrist bones that allows them to grasp bamboo stalks.</p>
                    <p>Pandas primarily inhabit bamboo forests in the mountains of central China. Pandas are classified as carnivores, but their diet consists almost entirely of bamboo. There are two species of panda: the giant panda and the red panda.</p>

                    <strong><p>Panda populations</p></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Giant Pandas: Approximately 1,864 individuals in the wild.</li>
                        <li>Red Pandas: Estimated 10,000 individuals in the wild.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The giant panda lives exclusively in six montane regions in a few Chinese provinces at elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft). It is solitary and gathers only in mating seasons. It relies on olfactory communication to communicate and uses scent marks as chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months. The oldest known giant panda was 38 years old.

As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. The Fourth National Survey (2011–2014), published in 2015, estimated that the wild population of giant pandas aged over 1.5 years (i.e. excluding dependent young) has increased to 1,864 individuals, based on this number and using the available estimated percentage of cubs in the population (9.6%) the IUCN estimated the total number of Pandas to be approximately 2,060.</p>
