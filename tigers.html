                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <p>Tigers are the largest cat species in the world, known for their distinctive orange coat with black stripes. They are solitary hunters and primarily prey on large ungulates.</p>
                    <p>Often found in a variety of habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, and savannas. They are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. Several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Indochinese tiger, Malayan tiger, Siberian tiger, South China tiger, and Sumatran tiger. Each subspecies has adapted to its specific environment.</p>
                    <p>Scientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor. The tiger is classified as Panthera tigris, and its subspecies are recognized based on genetic and morphological differences.</p>
                    <p>In the wild, tigers are primarily solitary
                    animals, although they may come together during mating season or when a mother is raising her cubs. They are territorial and mark their territory with scent markings.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their populations and habitats.</p>
                    <br>
                    <strong><p>Tiger populations</p></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bengal tiger: Approximately 2,500 individuals</li>
                        <li>Indochinese tiger: Approximately 1,200 individuals</li>
                        <li>Malayan tiger: Approximately 250 individuals</li>
                        <li>Siberian tiger: Approximately 500 individuals</li>
                        <li>South China tiger: Possibly extinct in the wild</li>
                        <li>Sumatran tiger: Approximately 400 individuals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce. The tiger is legally protected in all range countries. National conservation measures consist of action plans, anti-poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations. In several range countries, wildlife corridors have been established and tiger reintroduction is planned.</p>
