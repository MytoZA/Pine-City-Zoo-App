                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are primates that are generally considered to be more intelligent than other animals. They are known for their playful behavior and social structures.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys are found in various habitats, including forests, savannas, and mountains. They are primarily herbivorous, but some species also eat insects and small animals.</p>
                    <p>There are over 260 species of monkeys, which are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys (found in the Americas) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia).</p>
                    <p>Scientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor. The New World monkeys and the Old World monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination was not, since it excluded hominoids (apes and humans). Thus, the term "monkey" no longer referred to a recognized scientific taxon. The smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder Simiiformes, or simians. However this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians. Colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids.[34] In addition, arguments have been made for a monophyletic usage of the word "monkey" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics.</p>

                    <strong><p>Monkey populations</p></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New World monkeys: Approximately 150 species, including capuchins, howler monkeys, and spider monkeys.</li>
                        <li>Old World monkeys: Approximately 135 species, including macaques, baboons, and mandrills.</li>
                        <li>Monkeys are found in tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The many species of monkey have varied relationships with humans. Some are kept as pets, others used as model organisms in laboratories or in space missions. They may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled.</p>
