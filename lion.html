                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p> The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears. It is the second-largest living cat after the
                    tiger. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult.
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>
                    <p> The lion is a member of the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is one of the four big cats in the genus Panthera, and is the only member of the genus Panthera to live in social groups. The lion's closest living relatives are the jaguar, leopard, and tiger.</p>
                    <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>

                    <strong><p>Lion populations</p></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the wild, lions can live up to 10-14 years.</li>
                        <li>In captivity, they can live up to 20 years or more.</li>
                        <li>Lions are currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.</li>
                        <li>There are an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 lions left in the wild.</li>
                        <li>Lions are found in sub-Saharan Africa and a small population exists in the Gir Forest of India.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions have occurred worldwide, particularly as a symbol of power and royalty.</p>
