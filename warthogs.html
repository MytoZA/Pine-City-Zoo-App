                    <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs are wild pigs that are native to Africa. They are known for their distinctive tusks and bristly hair.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs are members of the family Suidae, which includes pigs and hogs. They are characterized by their large heads, tusks, and bristly hair. Warthogs are found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and woodlands.</p>
                    <P>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog). They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.</P>
                    <p>Warthogs are omnivorous, feeding on a diet of grasses, roots, fruits, and small animals. They are known for their ability to dig for food using their tusks.</p>
                    <p>Warthogs are social animals, often found in groups called sounders. They are known for their distinctive appearance, with large tusks that can grow up to 25 cm (10 inches) long. Warthogs use their tusks for defense against predators and for digging in the ground for food.</p>
                    <br>
                    <strong><p>Warthogs populations</p></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Common Warthog: Approximately 250,000 individuals in the wild.</li>
                        <li>Desert Warthog: Approximately 50,000 individuals in the wild.</li>
                        <li>Warthogs are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including savannas, grasslands, and woodlands.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, a warthog's body and head appear largely bare, from a distance, with only a crest of hair along the back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious. The English name "wart"-hog refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. The males also have very prominent tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres); females' tusks are always smaller.</p>
