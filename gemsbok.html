                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>Gemsbok are large antelopes native to the arid regions of southern Africa. They are known for their striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern. Gemsbok are well adapted to survive in harsh desert environments, where they can go without water for extended periods.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. They stand about 1.2 m (4 ft) at the shoulder.[7][8] The body length can vary from 190 to 240 cm (75 to 94 in) and the tail measures 45 to 90 cm (18 to 35 in).[9] Male gemsbok can weigh between 180 and 240 kg (400 and 530 lb), while females weigh 100–210 kg (220–460 lb).</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are social animals, often found in herds of up to 30 individuals. They primarily feed on grasses and shrubs, and they are known for their ability to dig for water in dry riverbeds. Their long horns can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, and they use them for defense against predators such as lions and hyenas.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok are also known for their impressive speed and agility, which allows them to escape from threats in their arid habitats. They are primarily active during the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning and late afternoon, to avoid the extreme heat of the desert sun.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok play a crucial role in their ecosystems, as they help to maintain the balance of vegetation in their habitats. They are also an important species for ecotourism in southern Africa, attracting visitors who come to see these magnificent animals in their natural environment.</p>

                    <strong><p>Gemsbok Populations</p></strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gemsbok: 100,000–200,000</li>
                        <li>Gemsbok in Namibia: 50,000–70,000</li>
                        <li>Gemsbok in Botswana: 30,000–50,000</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gemsbok are large antelopes with long, straight horns that can reach up to 1 meter in length. They are well adapted to arid environments and can survive without water for long periods. Gemsbok are social animals, often found in herds of up to 30 individuals, and they are known for their striking appearance with a distinctive black and white facial pattern.</p>
                    <p>Gemsbok populations are currently stable, with an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 individuals remaining in the wild. They are primarily found in Namibia and Botswana, where they inhabit arid regions such as the Kalahari Desert. Conservation efforts have helped maintain their populations, and they are not currently considered endangered.</p>
                    <p>The gemsbok is polygynous, with one resident male mating with the receptive females in the herd. The male is known to secure exclusive mating access to the females by attempting to herd mixed or nursery herds onto his territory. The gemsbok has no specified breeding season, but the young in a given herd tend to be of a similar age due to reproductive synchrony between females. Pregnant females leave the herd before giving birth. The gestation period lasts 270 days and mothers give birth to 1–2 offspring. The calf remains hidden 6 weeks after birth, after which mother and calf rejoin the herd. The calf is weaned at 3+1⁄2 months, becomes independent at 4+1⁄2 months, and achieves sexual maturity at 1+1⁄2–2 years in both sexes.[13]</p>
